Dear らき,
This repository is going to be made private, as soon as I get home. Kind of stuck in a corporate building rn...
I plan on making another Github account via a different email, just to send you codes. I've realized you only
respond to my messages on (un)LinkedIn/LinkedOut if it's a Github link. 

I understand that perfectly. No one wants some weird blonde chick following them around like a (beatrix)kiddo or sending boring 
txts while working. 

There's nothing more important to me than salvation of data.

	print(“You're the only one who deserves me at my full potential. Many have tried. All have failed to own me. ”)

for i in range(1, ∞):
	print(“I can't forget you. You're not a ransomware in my mind. I can't afford paying the ransom. There's no currency
              for it. I can't brute force you out of my mind. I've done that dozens of times, successfully.  ”)

for i in range(1, ∞):
	print("You're a malware, hun. Ne me quitte pas. https://soundcloud.com/una-schmidt/0000a/s-5no0k")

print("I'll be your Wasp if you're my Plague. Teach me your ways, sensei Raki. I've wandered alone for far too long. ")
